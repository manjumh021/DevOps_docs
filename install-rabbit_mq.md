1. **Update Package Repositories**:

   Before installing any software, it's a good practice to ensure your package repositories are up to date:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. **Install RabbitMQ Server**:

   RabbitMQ can be installed from the official RabbitMQ repository. You will need to add the RabbitMQ APT repository to your system and install RabbitMQ from there. First, add the RabbitMQ signing key to your system:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install curl
   curl -fsSL https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/erlang-archive-keyring.gpg
   ```

3. **Add the RabbitMQ APT Repository**:

   Create a new source file for the RabbitMQ repository:

   ```bash
   echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/erlang-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/ubuntu focal contrib" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/erlang-solutions.list
   ```

   Be sure to replace `focal` with your Ubuntu version (e.g., `bionic`, `xenial`) if necessary.

4. **Update Package Repositories Again**:

   After adding the repository, update the package repositories once more:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

5. **Install RabbitMQ Server**:

   Now you can install RabbitMQ using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
   ```

6. **Start and Enable RabbitMQ Service**:

   RabbitMQ is not started automatically after installation. You can start and enable the service with these commands:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server
   sudo systemctl enable rabbitmq-server
   ```

7. **Check RabbitMQ Status**:

   You can check the status of RabbitMQ to ensure it's running properly:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status rabbitmq-server
   ```

   You should see output indicating that RabbitMQ is active and running.

8. **Enable RabbitMQ Management Plugin** (Optional):

   RabbitMQ provides a web-based management interface that can be useful for monitoring and managing RabbitMQ. You can enable it with the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
   ```

   Access the management interface by visiting `http://your-server-IP:15672/` in a web browser. The default username and password are "guest."

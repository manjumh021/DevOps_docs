Creating a new GPU-LLM (GPT-4 Large Language Model) Ubuntu virtual machine (VM) in Azure.
**1. Log in to Azure Portal:**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com).
   - Sign in with your Azure account.

**2. Create a Resource Group (if needed):**
   - A resource group is a logical container for your Azure resources. You can create one or use an existing group.

**3. Click on "Create a Resource":**
   - In the Azure Portal, click on the "+ Create a resource" button.

**4. Search for "Ubuntu Server":**
   - In the Azure Marketplace, search for "Ubuntu Server" and select it.

**5. Choose Ubuntu Server Image:**
   - Select an appropriate version of Ubuntu Server as your base image. For GPU-LLM, it's recommended to use a version that supports GPU drivers and libraries.

**6. Configure VM Settings:**
   - Fill in the VM settings, such as the VM name, region, availability options, and resource group.
   - Choose the desired virtual machine series that supports GPU, such as "NC" or "NCv3" series.
   - Select an appropriate size based on your GPU and performance requirements. VMs with NVIDIA GPUs are typically used for GPU-intensive tasks.

**7. Administrator Account:**
   - Enter a username and password for the administrator account.
   - Optionally, you can provide your SSH public key if you prefer SSH for access.

**8. Inbound Port Rules:**
   - Configure inbound port rules to allow access to your VM. This may include opening ports for SSH, HTTP, or any other services you plan to run.

**9. GPU Configuration:**
   - Azure VMs with GPUs often require specialized GPU drivers and libraries to be installed. Consult the Azure documentation or NVIDIA's website for guidance on setting up GPU drivers and CUDA libraries.

**10. Additional Configuration (Optional):**
   - Depending on your specific use case, you may need to configure additional software and settings on your GPU-LLM VM. This could include installing DevOps tools, machine learning frameworks, or any other software relevant to your work.

**11. Review + Create:**
   - Review your settings, and when you're satisfied, click "Review + Create."

**12. Review + Create (Again):**
   - Azure will perform a validation check. If everything is in order, click "Create" to start the deployment process.

**13. Deployment:**
   - The VM deployment will begin. You can monitor the progress in the Azure Portal.

**14. Access Your GPU-LLM VM:**
   - Once the deployment is complete, you can access your VM using SSH.

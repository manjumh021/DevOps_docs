step-by-step on how to set up **FileBrowser** for secure web-based file access and editing, while ensuring user authentication, role-based access, and SSL encryption on **Ubuntu 20.04**. This will allow developers to edit environment (`.env`) files as needed, without SSH access.

#### **Step 1: Install FileBrowser**

1. **Download and Install FileBrowser**:
   - First, update the system:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt upgrade -y
     ```
   - Install FileBrowser using the following script:
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/filebrowser/get/master/get.sh | bash
     ```

#### **Step 2: Create and Configure the FileBrowser Service**

1. **Create a systemd service file**:
   - This ensures FileBrowser runs as a service and starts automatically after a reboot.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/filebrowser.service
   ```

2. **Add the following content** to the file to point FileBrowser to the environment files directory (`/home/vars`):
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=File Browser
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=root
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/filebrowser -r /home/vars
   Restart=on-failure

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

3. **Reload systemd and start the service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable filebrowser
   sudo systemctl start filebrowser
   ```

4. **Check if the service is running**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status filebrowser
   ```

#### **Step 3: Access the FileBrowser Web Interface**

1. **Open the browser and access the FileBrowser interface**:
   - URL: `http://<your-server-ip>:8080`
   - Default login credentials:
     - Username: `admin`
     - Password: `admin`

2. **Change the admin password** for security after the first login:
   - Go to `Settings` > `Users`, click on the `admin` user, and update the password.

#### **Step 4: Add Users and Assign Permissions**

1. **Create User Accounts** for each developer/team:
   - Go to `Settings` > `Users`.
   - Click `New User` to add new developers.
   - Assign each user access to specific directories (e.g., `/home/vars`) and set permissions (view, edit, etc.).
   
   Example:
   - User: `dev1`
   - Directory: `/home/vars`
   - Permissions: Read, Write

2. **Set User Roles** to control access levels:
   - Create roles with custom permissions if needed (for example, some users can edit, others can only view).

#### **Step 5: Secure Access with SSL (HTTPS)**

1. **Install Nginx** (as a reverse proxy to serve the FileBrowser UI over HTTPS):
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nginx
   ```

2. **Set Up Nginx Configuration for FileBrowser**:
   - Create a new Nginx configuration file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/filebrowser
     ```

   - Add the following content, replacing `<your-domain>` with your domain:
     ```nginx
     server {
         listen 80;
         server_name <your-domain>;

         location / {
             proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
             proxy_set_header Host $host;
             proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Enable the Nginx configuration** and restart the service:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/filebrowser /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

4. **Install Certbot** and obtain an SSL certificate:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
   sudo certbot --nginx -d <your-domain>
   ```

5. **Follow the prompts** to generate the SSL certificate. After completing, Nginx will automatically serve the FileBrowser interface over HTTPS.

6. **Verify HTTPS**:
   - Open `https://<your-domain>` in the browser and ensure it works securely.

#### **Step 6: (Optional) Configure Version Control for Environment Files with Git**

To track changes to `.env` files:
1. **Initialize Git in the environment directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/vars
   git init
   ```

2. **Add a `.gitignore`** file to exclude unnecessary files:
   ```bash
   echo "*.log" > .gitignore
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit of environment files"
   ```

3. **Create a post-edit Git hook** to automatically commit changes made through FileBrowser:
   - Edit `post-commit` hook to automatically commit file changes:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /home/vars/.git/hooks/post-commit
     ```
   - Add the following content:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Auto commit changes to environment files"
     ```

   - Make the hook executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x /home/vars/.git/hooks/post-commit
     ```

Now, whenever files are edited via FileBrowser, they can be automatically tracked by Git.

#### **Step 7: Testing the Setup**

1. **Login as a developer** and attempt to edit a `.env` file:
   - Go to the web interface (`https://<your-domain>`).
   - Login with developer credentials and edit files as needed.

2. **Verify HTTPS and File Editing**:
   - Ensure that file editing works smoothly and the web traffic is encrypted.

3. **Check Git Versioning (Optional)**:
   - After editing, check the Git history to ensure that changes are being committed automatically:
     ```bash
     cd /home/vars
     git log
     ```

---

This solution ensures:
- **Web-based access**: Developers can securely edit files via the browser without SSH access.
- **User authentication and permissions**: Each developer can only access their assigned directories.
- **SSL encryption**: Secure file access with HTTPS.
- **Version control (optional)**: Track changes to environment files.

Disabling swap in a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster is important for the following reasons:

### 1. **Memory Management**
   - Kubernetes assumes that all the nodes in the cluster use only **physical memory (RAM)** to manage the containers and their processes. Swap space is slower than RAM and can negatively impact the performance of applications running in the cluster.
   - If swap is enabled, Kubernetes cannot effectively manage resource limits (like memory) for containers, leading to unpredictable behavior and poor performance. Disabling swap ensures Kubernetes will be able to properly monitor and respond to memory usage.

### 2. **Kubernetes Scheduler**
   - The K8s scheduler relies on the node's available memory to make decisions about where to place new workloads. If swap is enabled, it could give a false impression of more memory being available, potentially over-scheduling the node and causing system instability.
   
### 3. **Resource Guarantees**
   - Kubernetes uses cgroups (control groups) to limit the memory a container can use. If swap is enabled, processes can use swap space when memory is exhausted. This means containers could potentially use more memory than allocated, undermining Kubernetes' resource guarantees and possibly causing memory contention issues.
   
### 4. **Best Practices**
   - Disabling swap is a best practice in Kubernetes deployments, especially for production environments, to prevent the node from using slow swap memory instead of real RAM, which ensures the applications run efficiently.

### 5. **Node Stability**
   - Running out of physical memory and relying on swap can cause nodes to become unresponsive or behave unexpectedly under heavy load. Kubernetes prefers **OOM (Out-Of-Memory) kills** over swapping. When swap is enabled, this OOM behavior may not work as intended, leading to performance degradation.

This is why you typically disable swap for Kubernetes nodes:
- **`swapoff -a`**: Temporarily disables swap.
- **Editing `/etc/fstab`**: Ensures swap remains disabled even after a system reboot.

In fact, Kubernetes will log an error if it detects swap is enabled on a node, and you may need to set `--fail-swap-on=false` in your Kubelet configuration to allow nodes with swap enabled, but this is generally not recommended.

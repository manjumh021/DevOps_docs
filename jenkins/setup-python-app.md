Here‚Äôs a complete step-by-step documentation you can include in your internal docs for enabling Jenkins to run `sudo` commands in a pipeline using **passwordless `sudo` access** via `sudoers`:

---

## üß∞ Setting Up Passwordless `sudo` for Jenkins in CI/CD Pipelines

### ‚úÖ Objective

Allow the Jenkins user to execute specific `sudo` commands (`mv`, `systemctl`) without being prompted for a password. This enables systemd service deployment or restart from within Jenkins pipelines securely.

---

### üîê Why Use Passwordless `sudo`?

* Prevents Jenkins pipeline from getting stuck or failing due to password prompts.
* Avoids storing sensitive passwords in Jenkins credentials.
* Ensures smooth, unattended execution in CI/CD environments.
* Limits sudo access only to necessary commands (minimizing risk).

---

### ü™ú Steps

#### 1. **Log in to the Jenkins Host**

SSH into the server where Jenkins is installed and running.

```bash
ssh user@your-server-ip
```

---

#### 2. **Open the `sudoers` file securely**

Use the `visudo` command to safely edit the `sudoers` file. This prevents syntax errors that could lock you out.

```bash
sudo visudo
```

---

#### 3. **Add the following rule for Jenkins user**

At the end of the file, add:

```bash
jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/mv, /bin/systemctl
```

> üîÅ Replace `jenkins` with the actual user Jenkins is running as, if different.

---

#### 4. **Save and exit**

* If using `nano` inside `visudo`: press `Ctrl+O` to save, then `Ctrl+X` to exit.
* If using `vi`: press `Esc`, then type `:wq` and press `Enter`.

---

#### 5. **Verify sudo access**

Switch to the Jenkins user (if not already running as it):

```bash
sudo -u jenkins -i
```

Then try the following test:

```bash
sudo -n systemctl status
```

* If you **don‚Äôt see a password prompt**, it‚Äôs working correctly.
* If you get a `sudo: a password is required` error, review the `sudoers` configuration.

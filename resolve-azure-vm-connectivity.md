### **Problem Description**

You were unable to connect to your Azure Ubuntu Virtual Machine (VM) via standard SSH methods. However, you could access the VM through the Azure Serial Console. Upon accessing the VM via the serial console, you discovered that:

- **DNS Resolution Failure**: Commands like `ping google.com` and `curl ifconfig.me` failed with DNS resolution errors.
- **Network Interface Down**: The primary network interface (`eth0`) was in the `DOWN` state.
- **Network Configuration Services Missing**: Attempts to restart networking services like `networking.service` and `network-manager.service` resulted in errors indicating that these units were not found.

### **Environment Details**

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu (specific version not provided)
- **Cloud Provider**: Microsoft Azure
- **Network Interface**: `eth0`
- **Access Method**: Azure Serial Console

---

### **Diagnostic Steps**

1. **Check Network Interfaces and Their Status**

   ```bash
   ip addr show
   ```

   **Output Analysis**:
   - `lo` (loopback interface) was up and functioning correctly.
   - `eth0` was present but **DOWN**, lacking an assigned IP address.

2. **Check Routing Table**

   ```bash
   ip route show
   ```

   **Observation**:
   - No routes were displayed, indicating no active network routes.

3. **Attempt to Restart Network Services**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart networking
   sudo service network-manager restart
   ```

   **Outcome**:
   - Both commands failed, indicating that `networking.service` and `network-manager.service` were not available or not installed.

4. **Inspect DNS Configuration**

   ```bash
   cat /etc/resolv.conf
   ```

   **Findings**:
   - The file pointed to `127.0.0.53`, managed by `systemd-resolved`.
   - No external DNS servers were directly listed.

### **Resolution Steps**

1. **Bring Up the Network Interface**

   Since `eth0` was down, the first step was to activate it.

   ```bash
   sudo ip link set eth0 up
   ```

2. **Verify the Network Interface Status**

   ```bash
   ip addr show eth0
   ```

   **Expected Outcome**:
   - `eth0` should now be in the `UP` state with `BROADCAST` and `MULTICAST` flags.
   - Initially, no IPv4 address was assigned.

3. **Obtain an IP Address via DHCP**

   Attempt to acquire an IP address from the DHCP server.

   ```bash
   sudo dhclient eth0
   ```

   **Post-Execution**:
   - `eth0` should now have an IPv4 address assigned by Azure's DHCP service.

4. **Check Netplan Configuration**

   Although initially, the `netplan` command was not found, inspecting the Netplan YAML files was still essential.

   ```bash
   sudo cat /etc/netplan/*.yaml
   ```

   **Sample Configuration**:
   ```yaml
   network:
       ethernets:
           eth0:
               dhcp4: true
               dhcp4-overrides:
                   route-metric: 100
               dhcp6: false
               match:
                   driver: hv_netvsc
                   macaddress: 60:45:bd:7f:94:6f
               set-name: eth0
       version: 2
   ```

5. **Apply Netplan Configuration**

   Although the `netplan` command was initially not found, ensuring that network configurations are applied is crucial. If `netplan` is unavailable, it might indicate a minimal or customized installation. However, after bringing up `eth0` and obtaining an IP via `dhclient`, connectivity was restored without needing to apply Netplan.

6. **Verify Internet Connectivity**

   - **Ping an External IP**:

     ```bash
     ping 8.8.8.8
     ```

     **Expected Outcome**:
     - Successful ping responses indicate that the VM can reach the internet at the IP level.

   - **Test DNS Resolution**:

     ```bash
     ping google.com
     curl ifconfig.me
     ```

     **Expected Outcome**:
     - Successful ping responses to `google.com` confirm DNS resolution.
     - `curl ifconfig.me` should return the VM's public IP address.

### **Explanation**

1. **Network Interface State**:
   - The primary issue was that the `eth0` interface was in the `DOWN` state, preventing any network communication.

2. **Bringing Up the Interface**:
   - Executing `sudo ip link set eth0 up` activated the network interface, allowing it to send and receive network packets.

3. **DHCP Client Assignment**:
   - Running `sudo dhclient eth0` prompted the VM to request an IP address from Azure's DHCP server. This assigned a valid IPv4 address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS servers to the interface.

4. **DNS Resolution**:
   - With a valid IP address and proper DNS settings (managed by `systemd-resolved` pointing to `127.0.0.53`), DNS queries were successfully resolved, enabling domain name-based communications.

5. **Absence of Network Services**:
   - The failure to restart `networking.service` and `network-manager.service` suggests that the VM might be using a different network management system or a minimal installation where these services are not present. However, manually managing the interface with `ip` and `dhclient` commands was sufficient to restore connectivity.

### **Preventive Measures**

1. **Ensure Persistent Network Configuration**:
   - To prevent the `eth0` interface from going down on reboot, ensure that the network configuration is correctly set in Netplan or the respective network management tool in use.

2. **Install and Configure Network Management Tools**:
   - If you prefer using `netplan` or `NetworkManager`, ensure they are installed and properly configured. For example:

     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install netplan.io network-manager
     ```

3. **Automate DHCP on Boot**:
   - Ensure that the DHCP client starts automatically on system boot to obtain network configurations without manual intervention.

4. **Monitor Network Interfaces**:
   - Implement monitoring to alert you if network interfaces go down or lose connectivity, allowing for proactive troubleshooting.

### **Conclusion**

The network connectivity issue on your Azure Ubuntu VM was primarily due to the `eth0` network interface being in the `DOWN` state, preventing the VM from obtaining an IP address and accessing the internet. By manually bringing up the interface and requesting an IP address via DHCP, the VM was able to restore network functionality, including DNS resolution and internet access.

For future reference, ensuring that network interfaces are correctly configured to start on boot and verifying the presence of necessary network management tools can help prevent similar issues.
